                <p>I am a senior technical theatre student at the University of Texas. I have a background in music,
                    and an interest in how competitive marching shows overlap with
                    theatre.</p>
                <p>Theatre feels like such an inclusive word, encompassing so many creative outlets and
                    artistic styles and allowing those who participate in it to connect with anyone who chooses to
                    interact with the performances. I've always been drawn to how the lighting and sound designs of
                    a play build upon the text. They build the world around the characters and allow the audience to
                    truly feel as though they are in the moment with the actors rather than just watching from the
                    outside. There is a magic in theatre that swirls around the stage to turn make-believe into reality
                    and I strive to draw it out so that others can experience and see it, too.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I compose music, write short stories and plays, play dungeons and dragons, and
                    engage with other art (music, books, paintings, etc.). </p>
